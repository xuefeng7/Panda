- extractFeature(image, [[xmin, ymin, w, h]]) -> [[feature vector]]
	
	This function takes an image, and a list of landmark points as input,
	it crops the interested areas and mirror it to four other directions, and then 		apply dense sift on each of them to obtain feature vector.

- waveletPCA([[feature vector]]) -> [[feature vector]]
	
	This apply the multilevel wavelet PCA to the feature vector to
	get and most principle feature and reduce the vector size for saving
	model trainining time

- trainModel(svm, [observations matrix]) -> svm

	A function trains the regression svm model

- crossValidation(svm) -> [score, roc]
	
	5-fold/10-fold cross validate the trained data and output the
	the score and display the ROC curve.
